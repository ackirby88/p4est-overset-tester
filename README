Compilation
 - run `./makescript`

Execute Examples
 - go to `build/bin/structured.2D`
 - execute by running `./run.sh`

There are more examples in the examples directory (which are copied to build/bin via ./makescript)
 - structured.2D   : 2D p4est cube with a box-defined refinement 
 - structured.3D   : 3D version
 - unstructured.2D : 2D unstructured gmsh (binary) format NACA0012 airfoil with box refinement
 - unstructured.3D : 3D version

To run in parallel (see the README in each example), edit (1) input.pdriver file and (2) the run.sh file.
